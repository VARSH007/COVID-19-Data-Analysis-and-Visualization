For this project, I obtained a COVID-19 dataset from Our World in Data and divided it into two Excel files - one for COVID deaths and the other for COVID vaccinations. I then uploaded these two files to Microsoft SQL and ran several queries to obtain insights such as the percent population infected per country, the overall percent population infected, the total death count per continent, and global numbers.

To further analyze the data, I performed some data cleaning and created visualizations in Tableau using the outputs from my SQL queries. The visualizations presented a clear picture of the spread of the virus and the progress of the vaccination efforts worldwide.	

The project demonstrated my skills in data cleaning, SQL querying, and data visualization, and my ability to gather insights from large datasets.
